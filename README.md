# Sale-Data-Summary-
This works contain summarized data from mockup JSON, inform about sales data.

First, the train data was in the `carsale.json`. Then, this data was linked with python-flask based endpoint, running on localhost at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/carsale.json`.

  To install flask, type `pip install flask` in terminal.

Then, to turn on the endpoint, first run the `app.py` python program. To run from linux terminal, just type `python app.py`. After that, open the file path as informed in the source code (as I mentioned above).

Then for the ease, I use jupyter notebook for the data analysis in `Sale Data Summary.ipynb`. To open jupyter notebook, you could directly open it from Jupyter Notebook application or type `jupyter-notebook` in terminal. I also provide the python version.

Then run the program, notice that maybe pandas (Python Data Analysis) library may be not installed. To install it, just type `pip install pandas` from terminal.
